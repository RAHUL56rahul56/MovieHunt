https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/   - Bootstrap link


created a react page + output first page Then details of projects
CSS	https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.6/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css   link

JS	https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.6/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js script
 

these above link are linked

created inside the src two folders
components
pages

step : 1
then create inside the src > pages
 Moviedetails.jsx
 MovieList.jsx 
 Pagenotfound.jsx
 search.jsx

step 2:
 then create src> components
 card.jsx
 footer.jsx
 header.jsx

step 3:
 the output is from app.jsx >> so, more contents are want to load this is make issue while loading. So>>
 inside the pages > create index.js file >> this file inside we export all details of pages
 like this files >>>  Moviedetails.jsx
 MovieList.jsx 
 Pagenotfound.jsx
 search.jsx >>>
 export {MovieDetails} from "./MovieDetails";
export {MovieList} from "./MovieList";
export {PageNotFound} from "./PageNotFound";
export {Search} from "./Search";  >>>

This same method use components also...

step 4:
i want to all routes are in single files
so,>> create inside >> src >> > foler - routes >>> All routes.jsx >>

we want to include routes go to main.jsx >> remove <StrictMode>  </StrictMode> >>next open terminal then type below
npm i react-router-dom -- this is for <StrictMode> replace this to  </StrictMode> >>> <browserrouter>  </browserrouter>
 
 then do browserRouter component then import above
 import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';

 step 5:
 Allroutes.jsx >> empty fragment >> inside the return >> create >this is want to create > routes > this is inside want to create> route --- > this is we can give stand alone tag.. 


      <Route path= "/"  elements={<MovieList />}/>
 path= "/" - initially want to empty >> elements is movielist component then we want to import when the movielis is have pages folder so we want to import pages folder

 import {Route, Routes} from "react-router-dom"; this line also want to import

step 6 :
Then go to app.jsx for inclueds the allrouter.jsx or all router file for show output
  <div>
        <Header />
        <Allroutes />
        <Footer />
      </div>  add this and case sensitive is main & import this files also >>
     
      import {Route, Routes} from "react-router-dom";
import MovieList from "../pages/MovieList";

one error is occur. Because the default export. in this place we change all files into index so we don't use default export. we want to use export directly

const Card = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      
    </div>
  )
}

export default Card; 
we want to change this model 
export const Card = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      
    </div>
  )
} this is correct for in this case . All components also want to change this type.. also the pages folder files want to change ..
fix all error
step 7: 
create navbar in components>>inside>> header > crated using bootstrap class and create by 
a tag brand name MovieHunt >>
created nav details 
moviehunt brand and home,top rated, popular & upcomming and search...

then create one button for responsive... above the collapse div

i want to google fonts. get embeded code and import the app.css file then *{
  font-family:inter;
}
then set body minimum height. Because, not have content it wil close. so, prevent this we set the minimum height for body.
then give padding top also for body then go to footer..

Step 7:
create footer then go to allrouter.jsx >> 
give title inside element>movielist  >title> then >>
      <Route  elements={<MovieList title="Your Guide to Great Movies" />} />
create new route for top rated movies..and popular & upcomming,..like etc create how many you want
 <Routes>
      <Route path="/" elements={<MovieList title="Your Guide to Great Movies" />} />
      <Route path="movies/popular" elements={<MovieList title="Popular Movies" />} />
      <Route path="movies/top" elements={<MovieList title="Top Rated Movies" />} />
      <Route path="movies/upcomming" elements={<MovieList title="Upcomming Movies" />} />
    </Routes> these all are completed and go to MoviesList to want to show the output
  
  Step 8:
  we use useEffect in this moviesList 
  to assign title to useEffect get from props of MovieList.

  debug __> eslint.config.js >> "react/prop-types":"off"; But i don't need this line..

  then go to link these above route to a tag in header 

    Step 9: 
    This all are do in header.jsx...below...
    one important think that is every click page is refresh this is not need refresh. That is have one solution that is a tag is changed to navlink & href change to to="" 
import { NavLink } from "react-router-dom"; this line is important to add before 
    vip : one important think that is we want to use anything before we want tot import this..
     NavLink is also same as  <a> tag but NavLink have more advantage..

     Step 10:
     create welcome banner --> go to MovieList ---> then after create banner and button
     button name is explore now --> that is hook new method to open upcomming movies...

     step 11:
     create card design go to components >> card.jsx
import backup from "../assets/backup.png"; import this line for image...
dummy image for card 
>> then create card descriptions

use link tag link tag is from reat-router-dom... this Link use alternatively by the <a> tag
>> we want to rating >> create i tag >> 

          <small>
            <i className="bi bi-star-fill"></i> this code for star
          </small>


step 12:

card size is big. So, we want to control the size by css styling..>> go to app.css >>>

------------------------
step 13: 
go to fetch api real time data...
create .env file on the project next save the below for hook because, hook is use more places.
VITE_API_KEY="c45c7eb18c47272757b1717d2de051fe" >>
then create hooks folder inside the src >> thne create the usefetch.jsx >>

entha api ku entha link kudukanum enru oru option irukku. So, athukaka namma api path i oru property
ya get pannidalaam..

important : 

    const url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3"
    >>> we give path
    const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/${apiPath}`;
    >>> we give api key
    const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/${apiPath}/${key}`;
    >>> while the user used the search parameter that place we use query parameter..
    const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/${apiPath}/${key}&query=${queryTerm}`;

step 14: 
set api path in the allroutes>>routes >>

put the api path to the allroutes >> to see get to the movielist.jsx >> then get data url from usefetch url..
   inside useFetch: 
    export const useFetch = ({apiPath, queryTerm = "" }) wrong
   export const useFetch = (apiPath, queryTerm = "" ) corrected


    const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/${apiPath}/${key}&query=${queryTerm}`; wrong

    const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/${apiPath}?${key}&query=${queryTerm}`; corrected


this is wrong code :

{/**
  This is my wrong code : ---
  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
 export const useFetch = (apiPath, queryTerm = "" ) => {
  return (
    const [data, setData] = useState([apiPath]);
    const key = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;
    
    const url = `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/${apiPath}?${key}&query=${queryTerm}`;
    useEffect(()=>{
        async function fetchMovies() {
            fetch(url).then((res) => res.json())
            .then((jsonData) => (jsonData.results));
        }
        fetchMovies();
    },[url])
  )
  return {data};
}

**/} in use fetch.jsx


all steps are completed for include images also.

-------------------------------------
start add fetures :

clear bug:- 
while click home like,, mouse want to up

new movie detail component :
-------------------------
full movie details while click :
create route for all routes.jsx
next go to card function
to={`/movie/${id}`} this two attribute. So, two curly bracis..


&query=${queryTerm} - no need search Term



--------------------------------
utils function for conver hours 
for movieDetails runtime util function



------------------
Search : 
first create route 
then import all form movielist


export const Header = () => {
  const navigator = useNavigate();
  const handleSearch = (e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    const queryTerm = e.target.search.value;
    e.target.reset();
    return navigator(`/Search?1=${queryTerm}`)
  }; program in header

  ------------------
  we want to create page not found..
  create empty route
